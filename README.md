<h1>Inventory Control Management Database</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I used SQL to create a database for manange inventory for a retail company.</p>

<h3>Functionalties</h3>

<h4>Add Products to the Database</h4>
<p>Whenever new products are ordered, you can add them to the inventory_info and products tables.</p>

<h4>Delete Products from the Database</h3>
<p>If a transaction occurs or a product is too out of date to keep, you are able to delete it from the inventory_info and products tables.</p>

<h4>View Product Info</h4>
<p>You are able to view data about each product in the inventory including their price, id number, and stock amount</p>

<h4>View Sales Info</h4>
<p>You are able to view the transaction history, monthly amount of sales, monthly amount of revenue, and much more information.</p>

<h3>Insights</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>People are more likely a product if it is sunny rather than if it's raining or snowing.</h4></li>
  <li><h4>People are equally likely to buy clearance products and non-clearance products</h4></li>
  <li><h4>The category that gets the most sales are clothing and shoes</h4></li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge was adding sample products and transactions to the database. As I got further through the project, I kept having the change column data and making sure it 
matches with all of the queries. But eventually in the end, I was able to create the data I wanted. However sometime in the future, I hope to be able to add supplier information so I can keep track of orders to make it more realistic. </p>
